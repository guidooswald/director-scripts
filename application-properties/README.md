# Cloudera Altus Director Server application.properties

The application.properties file in this directory is a mirror of the file
that ships with the Cloudera Altus Director server and which contains much of the
server configuration. The file normally resides at
`/etc/cloudera-director-server/application.properties`.

The file uses the [Java properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties)
format. Comments in the file document what each configuration property is for.
Example values are the defaults.

Restart the Cloudera Altus Director server after a configuration property change for
it to take effect.
